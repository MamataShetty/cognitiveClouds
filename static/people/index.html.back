        <p class="text-center h2-lead">CognitiveClouds fundamentally changes how the sourcing industry works by providing transparent communications from a globally distributed team of innovators, thought leaders, technical masterminds and product visionaries. Our process and tools ensure we meet your budgetary and time constraints while delivering the right product to your stakeholders and customers.</p>

As a partner, our success depends upon your success, so we share our best ideas with you to ensure you meet your business goals.</p>

        <p>For the past couple decades, our core team executed and managed products like yours at companies including IBM Watson Research, Oracle, Sybase, Cisco, Yahoo and Flip Video.

      </div>
      <div class="col-span-6">
        <p>We employ an agile product development methodology to craft robust software products. Products we build are always production-ready, which means you can base your decision to go live on business factors and not technical ones. With a relentless focus on application speed, bug-free code, and offline optimization, we use modern technologies to engineer cloud back-ends, responsive websites and mobile applications.</p>

        <p>New products and ideas keep our team excited and are the lifeblood of our company. We’re looking forward to learning more about how we can help you innovate.</p>

A no-nonsense company, our community of brilliant thinkers and doers value each other’s thoughts, which drive the products and processes of tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Improvements to process roll out upon validation and we place equal value on ideas from new assistants to seasoned engineers because we believe working smarter gives us time to innovate and do our best work. Regular company updates focus on transparent communication about what’s happening, where we’re headed and why.</p>

        <p>We bring the San Francisco software startup culture to India and abroad by allowing small talented teams to accomplish big things.
